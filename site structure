based on the user stories laid out, four pages are required
* a main page, with intro information about the site, as well as the option to login/register
* a practice page
* a user profile page
* and an admin page

all pages will also have a nav bar.
* when logged out, the navbar will allow the user to log in or register
* when logged in, the navbar will allow the user to edit their profile, switch UI language, and log out
* admin accounts will also log in from the navbar, but will be directed to the admin page instead of the practice page

to play the audio files, the html5 <audio> tag will be used with mp3 files. This will work in IE9+, Chrome 4+, FF3.5+,
Safari 4+, Opera 10.5+.

I plan to use a mix of TTS and human-recorded audio in the project, sourced from abair.ie and
