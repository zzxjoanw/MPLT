The goal of this site is to help language students differentiate between similar phonemes in their target language,
when one or both of those phonemes doesn't exist in the student's native language.

The user will be provided with a pair of words, differing only in one phoneme, for example, bit and beat. An audio
recording of one of the words will be played, and the user will be asked to select which word was spoken. The site will
use the Leitner system of spaced repetition, with the pairs of words being split among 5 'boxes'. The first box will
hold the pairs most in need of repetition, with the goal being to move all pairs into the final box. Giving a correct
answer will move the pair into the next higher box, while an incorrect one will return the pair to box #1.

Practice interval for each box
Box1:5 mins
Box2:30 mins
Box3:2 hours
Box4:5 hours
Box5:1 day

All pairs start in box 1.

If the lastPracticed value for a given pair falls outside the practice interval, that pair needs to be practiced.

If necessary, the number of boxes can be increased, and the time interval for each box can be adjusted; however, this
will be a site-wide change, not a user-specific one. (what happens to pairs in a box if that box is redefined or
eliminated?)
